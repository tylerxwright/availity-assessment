# Availity Assessment

Questions:
1. Tell me about your proudest professional achievement. It can also be a personal or school project.
* While working at Availity, I was a member of the RCM rewrite (reskin). We did this in Angular 1 and we had a pretty small amount of time to get it out the door. We all worked pretty late nights and were put up in a conference room. The amount of collaboration that was happening during this time was really amazing. This was also not just a frontend overhaul, it also required adding an api layer in front of the existing RCM legacy code. This was accomplished in C#.

2. Tell me about something you have read recently that you would recommend and why. (Can be a Github
Repo, Article, Blog, Book, etc)
* I recently read through Extreme Ownership: How U.S. Navy Seals Lead and Win by Jocko Willink and Leif Babin. This was recommended to me by a friend as I was trying to understand ways to work as effeciently as possible within some of the teams I had been lead on. It goes into a lot of stories from Jocko and Leif and how they adapted lessons learned on the battlefield into this book and lectures and team building they were part of after leaving the service. This book taught me a lot about being a good team player and taking ownership of problems. The book contains priciples that are explained by the authors through stories during their time as leaders on the battlefield. These principles are then shown how they can be applied to business.

3. How would you explain to your grandmother what Availity does?
* Availity works with insurance companies and providers to maintain, automate, and process healthcare insurance information. You can think of Availity as sitting between the providers and the healthcare insurnace companies. Availity eases the way healthcare information is communicated between each other. 

4. Coding exercise: You are tasked to write a checker that validates the parentheses of a LISP code. Write
a program (in Java or JavaScript) which takes in a string as an input and returns true if all the
parentheses in the string are properly closed and nested.
5. Coding exercise from a frontend perspective: Healthcare providers request to be part of the Availity
system. Using React framework, create a registration user interface so healthcare providers can
electronically join Availity. The following data points should be collected:
 First and Last Name
 NPI number
 Business Address
 Telephone Number
 Email address

6. Coding exercise: Availity receives enrollment files from various benefits management and enrollment
solutions (I.e. HR platforms, payroll platforms).  Most of these files are typically in EDI format.  However,
there are some files in CSV format.  For the files in CSV format, write a program in a language that seems
appropriate to you that will read the content of the file and separate enrollees by insurance company in its
own file. Additionally, sort the contents of each file by last and first name (ascending).  Lastly, if there are
duplicate User Ids for the same Insurance Company, then only the record with the highest version should
be included. The following data points are included in the file:
 User Id (string)
 First and Last Name (string)
 Version (integer)
 Insurance Company (string)
